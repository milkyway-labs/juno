// AnyUnpacker is an interface which allows safely unpacking types packed
// in Any's against a whitelist of registered types
type AnyUnpacker interface {
	// UnpackAny unpacks the value in any to the interface pointer passed in as
	// iface. Note that the type in any must have been registered in the
	// underlying whitelist registry as a concrete type for that interface
	// Ex:
	//    var msg sdk.Msg
	//    err := cdc.UnpackAny(any, &msg)
	//    ...
	UnpackAny(any *Any, iface interface{}) error
